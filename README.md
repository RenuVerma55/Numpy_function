5 Numpy Functions You Didn’t Know You Needed

NumPy lets us create multi dimensional arrays and lets us perform simple as well as complex operations like indexing, broadcasting, slicing, matrix multiplication. Today we’ll see how to organize your NumPy arrays better and compute some interesting operations using following functions. The functions are

numpy.sort
numpy.argmax
numpy.where
numpy.count_nonzero
numpy.extract
